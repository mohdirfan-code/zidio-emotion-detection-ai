# ü§ñ Zidio: Real-Time Workplace Emotion Detection AI

Zidio is an AI-powered emotion analysis system designed for **real-time monitoring** of employee well-being in workplace environments. It leverages **facial expression** and **voice tone** detection to infer **emotional states**, map them to **workplace moods**, and trigger alerts when stress is detected.

## üì∏ Demo 

### 1. üé• **Live Emotion Detection via Webcam**

Zidio captures **real-time facial expressions** using your webcam and detects the corresponding emotion using **DeepFace**.

---

### 2. üß† **Emotion Analysis Dashboard**

The **Streamlit dashboard** updates every few seconds to show:

- üßç **Facial Emotion**
- üéôÔ∏è **Speech Emotion**
- üß† **Final Mapped Mood**
- üö® **Alerts if stress is detected multiple times**

---

### 3. üìä **Mood Distribution & Logs**

A **bar chart** displays mood trends dynamically.

All detections are **logged in real time** with timestamps using a **SQLite backend**.

---

### 4. üö® **Email Alert System**

Zidio sends **automated email alerts** to HR when **stress or burnout** is detected repeatedly within a session.

Example:
